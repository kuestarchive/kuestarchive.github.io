Iâ€™m Komal Kedarnath G, a curious mind navigating the intersections of event management, content creation, and business development. With a knack for crafting immersive experiences, building connections, and telling compelling stories, I thrive in dynamic environments that blend creativity with strategy. Beyond my core work, I find inspiration in books, music, art, photography, and exploring the cosmos through telescopes. A generalist at heart, I embrace diverse disciplines, always eager to learn, innovate, and bring ideas to life.
